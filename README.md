Our goal is to add as much (fantasy-themed) content as possible, while staying true to the Vanilla feel of Minecraft. We have optimised the Modpack to run well on all types of computers, with the help of many performance mods, and we have tried to configure all mods to blend seamlessly with each other. If you are a nerd (like us), you will also appreciate the references and easter eggs about fantasy films/games found throughout the Modpack.

Fantasy Minecraft receives weekly updates adding more content and tweaks with each update. Quests are a work-in-progress, and we plan to add many more in the forthcoming updates. Polishing and bug-fixing is also in our to-do list for every update.

One thing we really appreciate is constructive feedback! If you decide to play Fantasy Minecraft, please let us know your thoughts about it or [report bugs](https://github.com/pixeldreamstudios/FantasyMinecraft/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.yml) you might encounter. If you have a grand idea, you can also [suggest things](https://github.com/pixeldreamstudios/FantasyMinecraft/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.yml)!
