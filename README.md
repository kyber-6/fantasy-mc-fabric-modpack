Our goal is to add as much (fantasy-themed) content as possible, while staying true to the Vanilla feel of Minecraft. We have optimised the Modpack to run well on all types of computers, with the help of many performance mods, and we have tried to configure all mods to blend seamlessly with each other. If you are a nerd (like us), you will also appreciate the references and easter eggs about fantasy films/games found throughout the Modpack. Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/pixeldreamstudios/FantasyMinecraft/wiki) for more details.
