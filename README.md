Our objective is to incorporate an abundance of fantasy-themed content into Minecraft, while maintaining the authentic Vanilla experience. The mod-pack has been optimized to ensure smooth performance across various computer systems, thanks to numerous performance mods. Furthermore, we have made diligent efforts to harmonize the configurations of all mods, aiming for a seamless integration. If you happen to be a fellow enthusiast (just like us), you will surely relish the clever nods and hidden surprises referencing popular fantasy films and games scattered throughout the mod-pack.
